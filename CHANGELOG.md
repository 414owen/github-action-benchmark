# [v1.1.0](https://github.com/rhysd/github-action-benchmark/releases/tag/v1.1.0) - 14 Nov 2019

- **New:** Added `auto-push` input
  - If this value is set to `true`, this action pushes GitHub Pages branch to remote automatically. You no longer need to push the branch by yourself.
  - Below `github-token` input must be set for this
  - This input is optional. You can still push the branch by yourself if you want
  - Please read [documentation](https://github.com/rhysd/github-action-benchmark#how-to-use) for more details
- **New:** Added `github-token` input
  - For doing some operations which requires GitHub API token, this input is necessary
    - pull from remote branch when your repository is private
    - push to remote branch
    - deploy and trigger GitHub Pages build
  - This input is optional. When you do none of above operations, this input is not necessary
- `README.md` was updated to avoid [the issue on public repository](https://github.community/t5/GitHub-Actions/Github-action-not-triggering-gh-pages-upon-push/td-p/26869) (#1)

e.g.

```yaml
- **name:** Store benchmark result
  uses: rhysd/github-action-benchmark@v1
  with:
    name: My Project Go Benchmark
    tool: 'go'
    output-file-path: output.txt
    github-token: ${{ secrets.PERSONAL_GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    auto-push: true
```

Note that you need to make a personal access token for deploying GitHub Pages from GitHub Action workflow. Please read `RADME.md` for more details.
